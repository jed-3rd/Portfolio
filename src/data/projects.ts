This strategy simply takes a conservative approach, staying when there is any chance at bust. This often leads you to stay at very low totals in the hopes the dealer will bust."],

The bottom right grouping is a 100% loss rate because this grouping represents the case when a player busts. The reason for this distinct groupings is because the dealer will use the dealer17 strategy, meaning the only time a score will be below 17 on the Y axis is when a player busts. In the second grouping there is a section of data at the vary top above the 20 on the Y axis that represents a dealers's bust. We then have a line of data ranging from 17 to 20 on both axis that represents the tie line. With the smallest tie coming when both hands are equal to 17 and the largest tie coming when both hands are equal to 20. There is small areas area above and to the left of the tie line that represents a player win but not a dealers bust. Similarily below and to the right of the tie line represents a player loss but not a players bust."],
        ['P', "In the chart we can see the range where the player didn't bust to be 4 datapoint wide, which is to be expected as it represents a dealers handscore of 17, 18, 19 & 20 as the player will always hit on something lower then a 17 and anything higher is a garenteed win or a bust. On average to tie players will have a hand of about 18-19 which makes since with this strategy because for no one to bust and for both players not to hit both of the hands must be in the 17-21 range. In addtion with this strategy you have a win percentage of about 42% which is not ideal as you win less then half the time, however your loss rate (due to the 8% tie rate) is also slightly under 50% at 49%, meaning you are losing about half your hands. Another interesting statistic that comes out of the data is on loss the players average hand is over 21, meaning that the majority of the losses come from the player busting rather then the player's score being beaten. This is seen with the density graph showing a warmer color in the top left of the bottom grouping of data showing that it is common to bust. The majority of the outcomes are still in thee scoring range in which niether player busts. The most common outcome was actually a 20-20 tie."],
        ['I', "Results of Dealer's 17 Simulation", require("../images/NoBustSim.png")],
        ['P', "Much of what was covered for the first graph hold 'T' to the second graph, however there are some key difference. With the more conservative strategy the bottom right grouping of data have shrunk in it's spread, in theory it should only be one dataset wide representing when the dealer gets a 21, however it is shown as 2 datapoint wide. The top left grouping has a much larger spread as the player will no longer hit on a score of 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16. Although this strategy eliminates busting, as is seen by the almost 7 points lower average hand score on loss, it does not improve your odds of winning. In fact this strategy proves very inefficent. With a win precentage of about 40% and a loss percentage of over 54% this would not be a wise strategy to employ. A interesting fact remains that dispite the different strategy the average score for tying remains almost unchanged, if you think about it from a probabilities stand point however this makes sense as the range for tying remains unchanged from 17-20 even though the range of player hand scores have changed. However, what has changed fairly dramatically is the chance for a tie, which makes sense because of the larger acceptable range of player score, however as we will see in our next strategy (which has a similar sized spread) this is not the full explination behind such a low chance to tie. This is due to the fact that there was no increase in the range of dealer hand scores. As shown in the density graph this method eliminates busting by the player and while maintaining the most likely outcome to still be a scoring finish. The most common outome was still a 20-20 tie joined by a 20-13 Dealer win."],
        ['I', "Results of Dealer's 17 Simulation", require("../images/ChartSim.png")],
        ['P', "Finally within the chart strategy we see a relatively even distrabution of point between groupings 1 and 2, both of which have a large range. Similar to the first Dealer 17 strategy we have a win percentage over 42% and a loss percentage of about 50%. However based on the loss average player hand it appears that you are far less likely to loss from busting then you were in the Dealer 17 strategy. In addition, furthering our insight from strategy 2, the average tie hand remains almost unchanged. Just as before the most likely player bust scinario is when the dealer has a score of 10, from this we can gather that the most common starting card for the dealer is 10, which if you examine the score weights in a deck of cards makes sense. In addition just like before the most common outcome is a 20-20 tie. Examining the density chart you will see the chart strategy and the Dealer 17 strategy have very similar density distrubtions, but with the chart strategy having a larger range of player scores. Looking closely to the actual chart strategy you can see that for the most part the chart follows a similar hit if below 17 guide as the Dealer 17 strategy."],
        ['P', "In conclusion we see that even using one of the 3 most popular strategies the odds are still not in your favor when you sit down at the blackjack table, although they are not entirely stacked against you. I would imagine if you run similar tests on the other forms of gambling you would find that although the odds are not in your favor they are better then most other forms of gambling. As for the strategies themselves we see that by a fairly significant margin the No Bust strategy is the worst with its win rate of about 40%. In researching strategies I found that many players and experts had already discovered as much, with most players contributing this strategies popularity with a psychological effect, being that for most players they rather loss by score then busting as a player busting has more of a feel of a player mistake then losing by score, which a player often feels like is due to luck not mistakes. The final two strategies are incredibly close in their win percentage with only a difference of 0.55% in favor of the chart strategy. However, as stated earlier the chart strategy is far more complex and difficult to master then the Dealer 17 strategy. This simplisity is a most likely a major factor in the reason dealers use the strategy. I would argue for a marginal increase in win probability it may not be worth the practice and learning of the strategy. In addition as seen in the density graphs the more complex algorithm gives a wider spread of possible scores for the player but the density distrbution do not change muchThe chart strategy however does limit the amount of losses by busts compared to the Dealer 17 strategy. In the case of the Dealer 17 strategy if you finish your turn without busting your probability of winning that round is relatively very high, however you have decent likelyhood to bust during your turn. Due to this difference in busting and the ever so slight edge in win percentage the chart strategy has emerged as the most popular and generally considered the 'best' strategy for blackjack."]
